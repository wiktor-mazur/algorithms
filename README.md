# Algorithms
This repository contains a bunch of different **algorithms** written in **JavaScript** in order to **practise** this area of knowledge.

Code in this repository is mainly **educational** and probably **should not be used in production**.

It is also written with **clean code** in mind, rather than **performance**. Please, let me know if you have noticed potential readability issue.

## Stack
- JavaScript (ES2015+)
- Jest

## Algorithms
So far I've managed to cover:
- [linear search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search) with sentinel
- [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
- [selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
- [factorial calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
- [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)

## Special thanks
I was inspired to create this repository while reading **"Grokking Algorithms"** by [Aditya Bhargava](https://github.com/egonSchiele).
Some of my work may be based on this book.
